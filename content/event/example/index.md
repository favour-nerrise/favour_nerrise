title: A Rookie Playbook for ML Beginners

event:  TWIMLfest
event_url: https://twimlai.com/twimlfest/

location: Remote

summary: This interactive session targets “newbies” to machine learning, especially students, emphasizing the breadth and depth of ML and the interdisciplinary applications possible. During the session, participants will interact with ML topics and datasets and have the opportunity to walk through the process of decision making to solving (by ML). We will also highlight some of the unconventional but necessary ways ML is applied, like through public policy, and engage in thoughtful dialogue about our future contributions.
